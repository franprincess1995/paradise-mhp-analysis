## Paradise MHP Analysis

For my Stanford Journalism master's thesis, I explored the status of the mobile home park rebuilds in Paradise, California, in the aftermath of the 2018 Camp Fire. To identify how prevalent mobile home parks were in Paradise before the fire, I compared the number of mobile home park lots in the town to other cities in California that had a similar population density pre-fire. 

The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis in ```/notebooks/Wrangling.ipynb```. Analysis follows in ```/notebooks/Analysis.ipynb```.

The completed story with data findings can be read on the [Peninsula Press.](https://peninsulapress.com/2022/07/07/i-just-miss-having-them-next-door-paradises-mobile-home-community-hasnt-been-rebuilt-3-years-after-camp-fire/)
